When browsing files in the Folder Browser and clicking on documents that can be opened in the editor, the documents are initially opened in a *Preview Mode*, which is a transient tab, that is removed when navigating to a different item in the folder browser or activating another tab. 

There are two available *Preview Modes*

* **Document Mode**
Shows the document in the editor as well as the split preview (if active), but the tab is shown in *Italic* which indicates the tab is in *Preview Mode*. Clicking into the editor or changing content in the editor causes the tab to flip into a non-transient, fully active editor instance.

* **Html Preview**  
Shows a full panel preview of the rendered HTML document. It's essentially a zoomed preview panel that shows just the HTML preview of the document. You can doubl

## Switching between Preview Mode and Normal Edit Mode
When a tab is in 'Preview Mode' it can be turned into a 'Normal Mode' tab in a few ways:

* **Double Click the file in Folder Browser**  
Double clicking in the Folder Browser **always** opens the file in full editor mode.

* **Click into or Edit an Editor Preview**  
If using the Editor based preview, you can simply click into the document or perform any operation that changes the document to turn the preview tab into a full editor tab.

* **Tab/Editor/Preview Context Menus**  
All the above context menus contain a **Open in Editor** menu option you can use to change the tab into a non-transient tab that shows the editor.

## Setting the Folder Browser Markdown Preview Mode
You can change the preview mode via the Settings form:
