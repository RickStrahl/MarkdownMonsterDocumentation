Markdown Monster uses an editor component called ACE Editor for its main editor. The editor is powerful and has a ton of core and advanced features.

Unfortunately, one feature that is missing is multi-line RegEx Find support. While the editor has support for RegEx searching, **it can only find per line RegEx Matches**. 'Lines' in this context are any text delineated by a linebreaks meaning it can be long paragraphs. The determining factor for a line are the terminating `\n` or `\r\n` characters.

This means there no support for cross line group matches or matching of `\n` or `\r` characters.
