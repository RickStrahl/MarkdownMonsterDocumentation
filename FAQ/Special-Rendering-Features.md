The following features are **Markdown Monster specific** and are not part of the Markdown 'standard'. 

### URL only Content: Browse the URL
If you have a document which contains only a URL on the first line, the url is rendered in the preview Window.

If you have just the following in a document:

```markdown
https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com
```

The preview will show the Markdown Monster site.

This can be useful, for addins which may customize output for rendering and may want to display an explicit URL rather than content. It can also be useful for documentation solutions that show external content.
