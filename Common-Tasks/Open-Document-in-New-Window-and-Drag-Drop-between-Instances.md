When you have an instance of Markdown Monster open you can use the editor's context menu - either from the editor or the editor's tab - to open the current document in a new window:

When you do this a new instance of Markdown Monster is started and the current document is opened in the new window. The document in the old instance is closed - if there are pending changes you are prompted to first save those changes.


## Drag and Drop between Markdown Monster Instances
Once you have multiple instances of Markdown Monster open, you can drag and drop documents from one instance into another by **dragging the document tab** into the other instance.

> Unlike **Open in New Window**, when you drag and drop **the old instance is not closed**, so the document will be open in both places. Although Markdown Monster can detect changes made in other instances and refresh it's recommended you close the old instance manually.
