Markdown Monster has support for Gists as embedded code snippets - and a host of other features - via a[ Gist Integration addin](https://github.com/RickStrahl/GistIntegration-MarkdownMonster-Addin) that you can install from the **Addin Manager**.

Here's some of the functionality of the addin:

> #### @icon-warning Important: Render Script Tags In Markdown Required for Previewer
> In order for embedded Gists to display in the Markdown Previewer, it's necessary to enable script rendering in Markdown Monster via the **Edit->Allow Script Tags in Markdown** setting. Without this setting scripts are not evaluated and Gists can't be previewed.


For more information on functionality and features please see the Gist Integration GitHub page:
