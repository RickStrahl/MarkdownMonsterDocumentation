            <p>Markdown Monster can be downloaded and evaluated for free, but a <a href="https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/purchase#License">license must be purchased for continued use</a>. Licenses are per user, rather than per machine, so a licensed user can use Markdown Monster on as many computers as needed. An organizational license is also available to use Markdown Monster for an unlimited number of installations within a single organization. Each individual user requires a separate license, unless an organizational license is used in which case the license is limited to members of licensed organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Licenses are valid for the major version for which it was purchased such as v3.0 to v3.99 with typical versions cycles between 2 and 3 years.</p>
<p>Upgrades run around 50% of full pricing, and upgrade charges are waived within 1 year of purchase of a new release.</p>
