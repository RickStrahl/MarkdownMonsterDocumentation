We want to hear from you, and you can contact us for support, questions and discussions, about Markdown Monster. 

## Technical Support
For technical support, bugs, feature requests or general usage discussion, there are a couple of avenues available to you:

* [Bugs and Feature Requests](https://github.com/RickStrahl/MarkdownMonster/issues) <small>(GitHub Issues)</small>   
The Markdown Monster **Github repository** can be used to report bugs, feature requests and any focused usability questions. Github Issues provide our official bug tracking mechanism, so you can also see what issues are open and what we're working on.

* [General Questions](https://support.west-wind.com/thread4nm0m17rc.wwt) <small>(Message Board)</small>  
For more general questions, or open ended discussion of features, licensing or perhaps questions about creating your own add-ins for Markdown Monster, the support forum provides a more open ended discussion forum. It's best suited to longer discussions or indirectly related issues to Markdown Monster's core feature set.

## Find your License
A common request is how to find your license information and registration key, for use with a new machine or a lost registration for an existing machine.  

License information is stored with your orders in your West Wind Store account:

[Log into your West Wind Store Account](https://store.west-wind.com/profile/)

Orders are listed at the bottom of your profile, drill into the specific order to display the license information for the line item.

### How Licensing works
Licenses are **machine registered** which means the software needs to be registered on each machine. A machine specific key is created when you register your license on a machine, and it only works on the machine that it was created on - each additional machine you register on, requires its own license activation using the provided registration key and registration email address.

If you need to find your registration key for Markdown Monster, it can be found in one of the following:

* **Your original Confirmation Email**  
Your original Email confirmation is sent from **sales&commat;west-wind.com** and typically includes the product name in email header.

* **Your Order History at store.west-wind.com**  
If you placed an order in our Web Store you can [log back into your account](https://store.west-wind.com/account/profile) using your email address. Once logged into your profile, you can see your **Order History** on the bottom of the page. Click on the specific order to view the invoice, and from there click on **Resend confirmations** to resend the product confirmation email(s).

* **Still can't find it?**  
If you still can't find your registration key you can contact us at **sales&commat;west-wind.com** and provide us with one or more of the following from your original order:

    * Order Number
    * Your Name and or Company
    * Your Email Address
    
    *Note: We'll only confirm emails back to the original email or same company addresses.*
