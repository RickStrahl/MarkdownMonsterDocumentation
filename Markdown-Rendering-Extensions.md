Markdown Monster includes a number of **RenderExtensions** that are add-on features to Markdown HTML generation. They provide often requested extensions to Markdown that can be selected used in your Markdown markup.

> Note that not all of these extensions are supported by all Markdown hosting services. None of these extensions are 'standard' Markdown,  so if you're hosting your Markdown on a platform like GitHub, WordPress or some Jekyll service, make sure the extension format is supported by your host. 

Markdown Monster can render all of these extensions and displays them in the previewer. It also can generate direct Html and PDF output from these extensions.
